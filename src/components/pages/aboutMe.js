                Developer with a passion for leveraging powerful technologies to change the world. 
                Recently earned a certificate in Full Stack Development from the University of New Hampshire. 
                Some of the technologies I learned include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, node, express, SQL, Mongo and react.js. 
                I also worked with a team in a leadership role to ensure larger projects got done in a timely manner. 
                I’m skilled at combining a strong technical understanding with a good sense of design to create powerful and intuitive web apps. 
                I enjoy self-directed learning and plan to continue learning new technologies in my spare time. 
                In particular, I’m excited to learn Python and explore AI and machine learning. 
                Ideally, I’d like to use my skills to help create environmentally sustainable companies. 
                I hope to bring value to a talented and diverse team with my creative problem-solving skills and my ability to learn quickly.
